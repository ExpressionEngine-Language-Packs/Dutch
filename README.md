# Dutch ExpressionEngine Translation

## Introduction
Recently EllisLab decided to put the languagepacks on Github for everyone to maintain. Sadly they don't let us put add-on translations in their repository. Also only one EE1 and one EE2 languagepack is supported, not multiple versions.

We need these translations anyway, so why not put our own translations of add-ons on Github? That's what we did. And hopefully other people will find these usefull, and contribute.

## Differences between our repository and EllisLab's
This repository has:
* Different versions of EE
* Forums and MSM languagepacks
* Add-on languagepacks, also different versions

## How to contribute?
